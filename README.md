# PathFinder
This program reads links from input.txt file. Searches for paths that can be done by using those links.

An example for input can be found in input.txt:
  1: define nodes as A1 A2 A3 B2 B3 and write it on first line separated by comma.
  2: define node links by using arrows like A1->A3 each line. It means its possible to go from A1 to A3
  3: write down the paths that you want to be checked by program. Program will output the results in output.txt
